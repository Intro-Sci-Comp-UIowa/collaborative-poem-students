What a day it is

It is Thursday

I like Thursday because it is always sunny

And it is getting less cold
But it's Iowa

Iowa, the main exporter of soybean, pork and corn in the US

Iowa, home to the smallest amount of oceanfront property in the US

The heavy snow followed by a week of frost-bite alerts

Iowa, at least we're not Nebraska

Iowa, where 30 degrees fahrenheit is considered a heat wave
